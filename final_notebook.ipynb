    "# Predicting Life Expectancy (WHO)\n",
    "by: Kristofer Rivera - 04/27/2022\n",
    "\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The data set was acquired from Kaggle user KUMARRAJARSHI: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kumarajarshi/life-expectancy-who\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Although there have been lot of studies undertaken in the past on factors affecting life expectancy considering demographic variables, income composition and mortality rates. It was found that affect of immunization and human development index was not taken into account in the past. Also, some of the past research was done considering multiple linear regression based on data set of one year for all the countries. Hence, this gives motivation to resolve both the factors stated previously by formulating a regression model based on mixed effects model and multiple linear regression while considering data from a period of 2000 to 2015 for all the countries. Important immunization like Hepatitis B, Polio and Diphtheria will also be considered. In a nutshell, this study will focus on immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors as well. Since the observations this dataset are based on different countries, it will be easier for a country to determine the predicting factor which is contributing to lower value of life expectancy. This will help in suggesting a country which area should be given importance in order to efficiently improve the life expectancy of its population.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this project is to use economic and public health data acquired from the (WHO) World Health Organization spanning 2000 - 2015 to predict life expectancy. \n",
    " \n",
    "## Process\n",
    "\n",
    "Upon successful acquistion of the *WHO* dataset from Kaggle. It was then transformed into a series of DataFrames which could be used in exploration and model creation. The intial raw dataframe consisted of, 2938 rows and 22 columns. For data cleaning, columns were renames, null values imputed for using the mean and a dummy variable was created for development status. My cleaned data set had the same amount of rows and columns. Through statistical testing and exploratory analysis, I was able to determine top drivers of life expectancy including: 'income_composition_of_resources', 'schooling', 'hiv_aids', 'gdp', 'developing', and 'bmi.' Using these drivers as features, I built several types of regression models to predict life expectancy and evaluated my best model, a polynomial regression model, on out-of-sample data. This model was able to predict life_expectancy with 84% accuracy and a RMSE score on 3.81. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Focused Questions\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Is there a linear relationship between income composition of resources and life expectancy?\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Is there a linear relationship between schooling and life expectancy? Is this a real correlation or is it because schooling is correlated with income composition? Which is the more important causal variable for life expectancy?\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Is there a significant relationship between status as a developing country and infant mortality?\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Is there a signifiant relationship between gdp and life expectancy?\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Is there a linear relationship between hiv_aids prevelance and life expectancy?"
